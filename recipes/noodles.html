    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is either rolled flat and cut, stretched, or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures and made into a variety of shapes.</p>
    <p>The most common noodles are those derived from either Chinese cuisine or Italian cuisine. Chinese noodles are known by a variety of different names, while Italian noodles are known as pasta. </p> 
    <p>   Cucumber raita generally tones down the spicy food. Since yogurt and cucumber (called kakdi or Kheera in Hindi) have cooling properties, they help to balance the heat from spicy food. </p>
