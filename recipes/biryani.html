    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.</p>
    <p>   In a pakki biryani, the rice, marinated meat, and any vegetables are partially ("three-quarters") cooked separately, before being combined into layers in a cooking vessel. Different layers of rice may be treated with different spices (e.g., with dissolved saffron or turmeric to give the rice different colours and flavours). The contents are then baked to complete the cooking and allow the flavours to combine. Alternatively, the components may be fully cooked, and then simply combined by layering before serving.</p> 
    <p>   In a kacchi biryani, layers of raw marinated meat are alternated in layers with wet, pre-soaked, raw rice (which may be treated with different spices as above), and cooked together by baking, or medium-to-low direct heat (typically, for at least an hour). Cooking occurs by a process of steaming from the ingredients' own moisture: the cooking vessel's lid is sealed (traditionally, with a strip of wheat dough) so that steam cannot escape (proper dum pukht).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Ginger and Garlic paste</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Whole Spices</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a big pot with a heavy bottom or a Dutch oven, mix the chicken marinade</li>
        <li>Toss the chicken pieces in this mixture and let it sit for at least 30 minutes. The longer you wait (up to 10 hours!), the tastier the chicken will be. </li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt, whole spices, and rinsed basmati rice.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for 8-10 minutes, stirring it around sometimes. Then turn off the heat. The chicken should be about 70% cooked through.</li>
        <li>Then, add the parboiled rice on top, spreading it evenly. Press it down a little with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Top it off with the remaining fried onions, mint, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Put a tight lid on the pot. You can even wrap a kitchen towel around the lid to seal it tightly. This will keep all the steam inside.</li>
        <li>Take the pot off the heat and let the biryani rest for another 5-10 minutes. This will allow the flavors to come together.</li>
        <li>When ready to eat, fluff the biryani with a fork and serve it. Try to get a bit of everything in each scoop - chicken, yellow rice (from the saffron milk), white rice, and fried onions. Garnish with extra fried onions and cilantro for a pop of color!</li>
    </ol>
