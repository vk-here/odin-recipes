    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In India, we have a variety of raita recipes. You can make raita with cucumber, onions and tomatoes, pineapple, boondi (fried gram flour balls) or even with bottle gourd. Raita is an integral part of our meals. It pairs perfectly with Indian curries and biryanis!</p>
    <p> This is a classic homemade Cucumber Raita, made in most Indian households. It is served with biryani or pulao. There are so many different versions of raita, and each family has its favorite recipe. </p> 
    <p>   Cucumber raita generally tones down the spicy food. Since yogurt and cucumber (called kakdi or Kheera in Hindi) have cooling properties, they help to balance the heat from spicy food. </p>
